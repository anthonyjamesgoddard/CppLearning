		1. Find the LCM of A, L. Hence our candidates must be a multiple of L 
		2. Find the GCD of B, G. Hence our condidates must divide G
		3. Find how many divisors are in G/L

		Note that for some candidate n, L|n|G --> n/L | G/L. If we can find how many divisors G/L has then 
		then we know how many candidates n there are that are between both sets. The outline is just provided
		as this requires some boilerplate cading to get going.
